A [clj-http](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http) client to integrate with [Strawpoll.](https://strawpoll.com/en/)

This repository follows the guidelines and standards of the [Wall Brew Open Source Policy.](https://github.com/Wall-Brew-Co/open-source "Our open source guidelines")

## DEPRECATION NOTICE

As of 2024-03-10, this library has been deprecated and will no longer receive updates.
If you wish to continue using the functionality within this library, feel free to fork this repository or to reuse the contents within: As a reminder, this code is provided under the MIT License.

## Installation

A deployed copy of the most recent version of [strawpoll-client can be found on clojars.](https://clojars.org/com.wallbrew/strawpoll-client)
To use it, add the following as a dependency in your project.clj file:

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/com.wallbrew/strawpoll-client/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.wallbrew/strawpoll-client)

The next time you build your application, [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) or [deps.edn](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli) should pull it automatically.
Alternatively, you may clone or fork the repository to work with it directly.

## Public Functions

### Authorization

Integrating with Strawpoll requires setting up an API Key with your user account.
Strawpoll provides documentation on generating this key in their [API documentation.](https://strawpoll.com/en/api-docs/authentication/)

Since this value is required for each HTTP call to their interface, strawpoll-client has adopted a component/client pattern.
Each of the functions used to interact with Strawpoll expect a client generated by `strawpoll-client.core/->client` as its first argument.

This function expects an option map, with the following key sets:

- `:api-key` - Your Strawpoll API key as a string.
             If this key is missing, the library will attempt to load the Environment variable `STRAWPOLL_API_KEY` and the JVM Property `StrawPollApiKey` in this order.
             All remaining keys in this map will be passed to the underlying [clj-http request function](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http)

### Poll Lifecycles

As stated, each function will require a client, so we create one first:

```clojure
(:require [strawpoll-client.core :refer :all])

(def my-client (->client {:api-key "My-awesome-secret"}))
```

Now, we will use this client to create a basic poll with the following options:

- Cats
- Dogs
- Rabbits

```clojure
(create-poll! my-client "What is your favorite animal?" ["Cats" "Dogs" "Rabbits"])
;; => {:admin_key "some-key" :content_id "jkooopjr5" :success 1}
```

`create-poll!` makes each of the options from [Strawpoll's API](https://strawpoll.com/en/api-docs/create-poll/) available via an optional option map with the following keys:

- `:public?` - A boolean to determine wether or not the poll will be publicly listed. Defaults to falsey
- `:disallow-comments?` - A boolean to disable commenting on polls. Defaults to falsey
- `:multiple-answers?` - A boolean to indicate wether each voter is allowed to vote on multiple options. Defaults to falsey
- `:multiple-votes-per-ip?` - A boolean to indicate if multiple votes may be recorded from a single IP address. Defaults to falsey
- `:name-required?` - A boolean to indicate if users must enter a name while voting. Defaults to falsey
- `:deadline` - An ISO-8601 Datetime in Zulu Timezone past when the poll will close. Defaults to nil, ergo no closing date will be set
- `:only-registered-users?` - A boolean to indicate if users will be required to have an account with strawpoll.com in order to vote. Defaults to falsey
- `:allow-vpn-users?` - A boolean to indicate if users behind a VPN will be allowed to vote. Defaults to falsey
- `:no-captcha?` - A boolean indicating if voting in the poll will not require solving a captcha. Defaults to falsey, meaning users will have to complete this step

After a while, we accumulate some votes, and we decide to check on the status of our poll.

```

If we navigate `:content -> :poll -> :poll_answers`, we can see that rabbits have a commanding lead.

When we created our poll, Strawpoll sends us back a map of data.
The `content_id` key of that map contains the string we need to get the poll's state and to delete the poll.
A convenience function has been added to extract this value:

```clojure
(->poll-id (create-poll! my-client "What is your favorite animal?" ["Cats" "Dogs" "Rabbits"]))
;; => "jkooopjr5"
```

Eventually, enough time passes and we decide to delete our poll for good.

```clojure
(delete-poll! my-client "jkooopjr5")
;; {:message "Delete successful!" :success 1}
```

### REPL Driven Development

To try out this library's functionality, load `strawpoll-client.repl` into your REPL.
This namespace has a Rich comment block demonstrating basic usage of each function.
All you need to do is update the API key in `->client`.
Be sure you remove this value before committing this code.
The API key ought to be treated as any application secret would be.
